# 📊 Comprehensive Retail Sales Analysis using Python (End-to-End)

This project showcases an end-to-end Retail Sales Analysis using Python, covering data cleaning, merging multi-sheet files, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and actionable business insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Analyzed 64,000+ sales records across customers, products, states, channels, and budgets.
- Cleaned & merged 6 datasets (Sales, Customers, Products, Regions, Budgets, State Regions).
- Engineered KPIs: Total Cost, Profit, Profit Margin.
- Performed EDA to uncover trends, outliers, and business opportunities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights (Numbers Included)

- Annual Revenue: ~₹300 Cr consistently (2014–2017).
- Top Channel: Wholesale (54% revenue).
- Top State: California (₹228 Cr).
- Top Products: Product 26 & 25 generate ₹228 Cr combined.
- Highest Margin: Export channel (~38%).
- AOV: Stable between ₹19k – ₹21k.
- No correlation between revenue & margin — margin depends on cost structure.
